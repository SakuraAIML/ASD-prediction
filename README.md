# ASD-prediction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a brain development disorder that limits individualsâ€™ capacity for linguistic,
communication, cognitive, and social skills. The causal nature of ASD has been associated with genetic and neurological factors.
However, in some cases, the factors leading to the development of ASD are not so apparent such that those who have been diagnosed with ASD
can also exhibit outstanding non-academic, artistic capabilities, thus, posing a challenging task for healthcare professionals to detect ASD
at an early stage and improve the precision and quality of the diagnosis. In the last few years, scientists have made substantial efforts to
implement computationally intelligent techniques such as classification methods for detecting concealed patterns of ASD among patients,
thereby mediating the decision-making process for diagnoses/prognoses of ASD. Therefore, this report presents the implementations of 
tree-based algorithms (Classification Tree, Bagging, and Random Forest) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in a binary classification task for 
predicting the development of ASD among child patients. The primary purpose of this report is to explore the use of these methods in predicting ASD
using a real dataset and to understand how vary is their predictive performance.  Therefore, different models were fitted and compared to determine
each prediction accuracy.
